# Refinery VTT

Refinery is a self-hostable virtual table top system. It is only just beginning,
so don't count on it for your latest (or maybe your next couple) campaigns.

## Goals

The goals of this project include:

### Characters

- [ ] Generate character sheets
- [ ] Keep track of character sheets
- [ ] Avatar creation base on preset characters

### Rules

- [ ] Allow GMs pick from preset rules
- [ ] Allow GMs make their own rules
- [ ] Allow GMs modify rules

### Automation

- [ ] Allow GMs to create automations that make story immersion easier
- [ ] **Dream**: Allow GMs to trigger physical media (such as lights, fog, sounds,
      etc.) using in-built scripting

### Communication

- [ ] Chat platform that supports both in and out of character chats
- [ ] **Dream**: Voice chat with voice processing for in-character

### Map Visualization

- [ ] Show where players are on the map in a pleasing way
- [ ] Support various emotes for each player
- [ ] Per-player/per-group visibility limitations option

### Self-hosting

- [ ] The whole system should be easily self-hostable (ideally just a single binary)
- [ ] The system should be easy to migrate between host computers (i.e. data easily separable)
